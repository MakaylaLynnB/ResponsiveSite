   My experience with web design and development before this semester was
   very limited. In this semester I took WEB 115 which taught me HTML, CSS,
   and Javascript. I also am taking CSC 151 which teaches me Java programming. I hope to be able to be the best web designer I can possibly be by learning in every aspect of the field. My dream is to one day be able to do freelance work from home using my web design skills learned in the WEB classes associated with the Web Administration and Design degree.
